关联CR-972883，缺少对ISIM refresh voting的响应。

Title：DS3GMMGSDI client is registering for ISIM refresh voting but there was no response for Refresh.
Problem Description：DS is not handling WAIT_FOR_OK_TO_FCN stage during refresh and thus ISIM refresh test cases are failing.
Change Description：Handle WAIT_FOR_OK_TO_FCN stage when ISIM refresh happens. Process new ISIM ok_to_refresh event.
