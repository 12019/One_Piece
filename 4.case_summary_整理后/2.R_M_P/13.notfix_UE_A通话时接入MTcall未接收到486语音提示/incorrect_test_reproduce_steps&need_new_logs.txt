//第二个MO-call被置为Hold状态，然后又将第一个MO-call重新置为conversation状态，在这之后发起了一个conference-call流程
//the second MO-call be set to HOLD status, and the first MO-call process back to conversation status again...(this should be the precondition of call-conference process), and finally UE originate a call-conference process.

conclusion:
As we can see above, there is no MT-call initialized after MO-call process, of course there shouldn't appear "486(busy here)" msg here.
At the beginning, there is a msg about MT-call, but that's for terminal the MT-call, only we could see are some MO-call and a call-conference process in logs.

Maybe there are something wrong in it, plz check the reproduce steps and logs again, if you still have same issue, feedback with correct logs ASAP.
