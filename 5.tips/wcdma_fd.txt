正常来说，当终端已经没有数据交互，但RF依旧保持激活状态，长时间无法自动休眠，会造成额外的功耗。针对此情况提出了fast-dormancy(快速休眠)的功能，当终端满足一定条件(例如，无数据交互超过一定时间，假设一个定时器T1)后即可快速休眠。

【1】T1的值一般取决于
Screen state: ON: x secs / OFF: y secs
Tethering state(RNDIS SoftAp only): ON(a cellular interface): z secs, irrespective of the screen state

【2】T1(inactivity timer)配置：
//delay_time while issuing dormancy_request
dpm_fd_delay_time_timer_value:0

dpm_fd_screen_on_idle_timer_value: x
//Amount of time for which the interface must be monitored for idleness when the screen is on

dpm_fd_screen_off_idle_timer_value: y
//Amount of time for which which the interface must be monitored for idleness when the screen is off

dpm_fd_tethering_idle_timer_value: z
//Amount of time for which which the interface must be monitored for idleness when tethering is on

dpm_fd_enable_network_mask: mask
//Bitmask stating for which networks FD is to be enabled

[Recommended configuration example]
dpm_fd_screen_on_idle_timer_value:15
dpm_fd_screen_off_idle_timer_value:3
dpm_fd_tethering_on_idle_timer_value:15
dpm_fd_enable_networks_mask:0x28708
#Default 101000011100001000 (see next slide for the bit selection of each network type)

【3】配置文件路径
The default recommended configuration file is present in one for the following:
 /system/etc/dpm/fdmgr/fd.conf (targets not supporting TCM)
 /system/etc/dpm/dpm.conf (targets supporting TCM)

(!!!)OEMs can push their own configuration file to one for the following:
 /data/dpm/fdmgr/fd.conf (targets not supporting TCM)
 /data/dpm/dpm.conf (targets supporting TCM)

Configuration parser logic is as follows:
If a valid file is present in /data, it is used. Otherwise, the parser falls back to the file in /system. If for some reason the file in that location becomes corrupted and parsing fails, the parser uses the software hardcoded recommended values.

【4】network mode mask
#FastDormancy and TCM can be configured for a network type
#NETWORK_TYPE_UNKNOWN = 0
#NETWORK_TYPE_GPRS = 1
#NETWORK_TYPE_EDGE = 2
#NETWORK_TYPE_UMTS = 3
#NETWORK_TYPE_CDMA = 4
#NETWORK_TYPE_EVDO_0 = 5
#NETWORK_TYPE_EVDO_A = 6
#NETWORK_TYPE_1xRTT = 7
#NETWORK_TYPE_HSDPA = 8
#NETWORK_TYPE_HSUPA = 9
#NETWORK_TYPE_HSPA = 10
#NETWORK_TYPE_IDEN = 11
#NETWORK_TYPE_EVDO_B = 12
#NETWORK_TYPE_LTE = 13
#NETWORK_TYPE_EHRPD = 14
#NETWORK_TYPE_HSPAP = 15
#NETWORK_TYPE_GSM = 16
#NETWORK_TYPE_TD_SCDMA = 17
#NETWORK_TYPE_IWLAN = 18
#NETWORK_TYPE_LTE_CA = 19;

【5】FD enable/disable
To enable FD:
1. adb root
2. adb wait-for-device
3. adb remount
4. adb setprop persist.dpm.feature 1
This enables only the FD feature by changing the currently enabled features. If you do not want to disturb an already enabled DPM feature: read the property value, set the LSB bit to 1 on top of it, and then set the property.To update the config, do one of the following:
 adb push fd.conf /data/dpm/fdmgr/fd.conf
 abd push dpm.conf /data/dpm/dpm.conf
5. adb reboot

To disable FD:
1. adb root
2. adb wait-for-device
3. adb setprop persist.dpm.feature 0
This disables all the DPM features. If you do not want to disturb any other DPM feature and only disable FD: read the property first, set the LSB bit to 0 on top of it, and then set the property.

【DPM】
Features
Fast Dormancy (FD)
Connection Tracking (CT) – For modem filtering and modem FD
Network Socket Request Manager (NSRM)
TCP Connection Manager (TCM)

Persist property to control enable or disable
persist.dpm.feature (32-bit mask)
FD enable or disable – 0x00000001 (first bit 2 – LSB)
CT enable or disable – 0x00000002 (second bit)
NSRM enable or disable – 0x00000004 (third bit)
TCM enable or disable – 0x00000008 (fourth bit)

=================
【modem FD--CT】
Note that the CT feature works in conjunction with the following modem support: Modem performs filtering and drops packets for mismatched filters if the apps processor side installs a filter. Modem triggers FD if the network has established an RAB for data transfer and there no activity for 6 sec (configurable in EFS with TIMER_VALUE_1 below).
Enable or disable modem FD and filtering, and configure FD timer values To enable or disable the FD feature, push the fast_dormancy.txt to EFS.
 EFS file location: /ds/qmi/fast_dormancy.txt
 Write 1 to enable
 Write 0 to disable
If the fast_dormancy.txt file is not present in EFS, FD is enabled by default.

To configure FD timer values in milliseconds, push the fast_dormancy_config.txt to EFS.
 EFS file location: /nv/item_files/modem/data/3gpp/fast_dormancy_config.txt
 TIMER_VALUE_1:xxxx; // FD timer with no packet drops
 TIMER_VALUE_2:yyyy; // FD timer when packets dropped
TimerRange must be less than 10 sec && (TIMER_VALUE_1 > TIMER_VALUE_2).
If the fast_dormancy_config.txt file is not present, default values of 6000 and 1000 are used, respectively.
